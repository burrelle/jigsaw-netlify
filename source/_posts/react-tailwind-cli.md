I have recently been trying to work on some quick projects each day to stay fresh with small projects outside of work. I found that I like the combination React and TailwindCSS together with Parcel Bundler, but I hadn't found a tool that made the process of starting up a new project easy. So, I created <strong>React-Tailwind CLI</strong>, my first NPM package.

The CLI is a utility for starting project with:
- React
- TailwindCSS
- Parcel Bundler
- Babel 7

To get started:
```sh
yarn global add react-tailwind-cli
```
To start a new project:
```
react-tailwind new [project-name]
```

Check out the [NPM Package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-tailwind-cli)!
